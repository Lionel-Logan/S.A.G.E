# ========================================
# SAGE Backend - Development Dependencies
# ========================================
#
# This file contains dependencies ONLY needed for development and testing.
# These are NOT required in production deployments.
#
# WHY SEPARATE?
# - Faster production builds (smaller Docker images, quicker deployments)
# - Cleaner production environment (no unnecessary packages)
# - Better security (fewer dependencies = smaller attack surface)
#
# INSTALLATION:
#   Development: pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
#   Production:  pip install -r requirements.txt
